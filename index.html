      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Take a look at a Psychologist. They get into that field because they want to know and understand how the human mind ticks and the reasons why people behave a certain way. When I was a child, my uncle and I would tinker with certain programs and files. Also, who didnt learn basic HTML from editing their MySpace? All of this stuff combined, it fascinated me. Wanting to know how websites and programs tick. Kind of like a sort of "Technological Psychology". </p>
